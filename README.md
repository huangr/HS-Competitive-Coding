CodeForces problems are from CodeForces.

USACO Training Problems are from the USACO training site.

USACO Problems are from the contests themselves.

The Harker Programming Invitational contest was a team-based algorithmic coding contest. I've uploaded our team's files here; writing all the files was a team collaboration process, not individual.
